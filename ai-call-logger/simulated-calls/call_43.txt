Hello, this is Dr. White from Hematology. I'm calling about a patient, Mary Johnson, MRN 223355667, DOB 1980-03-22. We sent a blood sample for Iron Studies, but the results are showing low ferritin levels. The patient is experiencing fatigue and pallor. Can you verify the results and let us know if we need to collect a new sample? The patient's condition is concerning, and we need accurate results to proceed with the treatment. Thank you.
