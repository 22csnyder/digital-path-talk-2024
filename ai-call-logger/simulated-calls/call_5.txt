Hello, this is Dr. Martinez from Pulmonary. I'm calling about a patient, David Green, MRN 789123456, DOB 1970-12-25. We sent a sputum sample for Tuberculosis testing, but the results are taking longer than expected. The patient has a persistent cough and weight loss, and we need to confirm the diagnosis to start the treatment. Can you check the status of the sample and expedite the testing process? The patient's condition is not improving, and we need the results urgently. Thank you.
