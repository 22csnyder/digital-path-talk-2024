Hello, this is Dr. Blue from Infectious Disease. I'm calling about a patient, Sarah Black, MRN 667799001, DOB 1985-12-12. We sent a blood sample for Hepatitis Panel testing, but the results are taking longer than expected. The patient has symptoms of hepatitis, and we need to confirm the diagnosis to start the treatment. Can you check the status of the sample and expedite the testing process? The patient's condition is not improving, and we need the results urgently. Thank you.
