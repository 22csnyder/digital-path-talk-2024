Hi, this is Dr. Green from Cardiology. I'm calling about a patient, David Brown, MRN 556688990, DOB 1955-05-05. We sent a blood sample for BNP testing, but the results are showing elevated levels. The patient has symptoms of heart failure, and we need to confirm the results to adjust the treatment plan. Can you verify the results and let us know if we need to collect a new sample? The patient's condition is critical, and we need accurate results. Thank you.
