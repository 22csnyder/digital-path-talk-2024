Hi, this is Dr. Harris from Cardiology. I'm calling about a patient, James Brown, MRN 445566778, DOB 1960-02-10. We sent a blood sample for Lipid Panel testing, but the results are showing abnormal cholesterol levels. The patient has a history of heart disease, and we need to confirm the results to adjust the treatment plan. Can you verify the results and let us know if we need to collect a new sample? The patient's condition is critical, and we need accurate results. Thank you.
