Hello, this is Dr. Clark from Oncology. I'm calling about a patient, William Harris, MRN 321987654, DOB 1955-09-22. We sent a bone marrow sample for Leukemia Panel testing, but the results are showing conflicting markers. The patient has symptoms of leukemia, and we need to confirm the diagnosis to start the treatment. Can you verify the results and let us know if we need to collect a new sample? The patient's condition is deteriorating, and we need accurate results to proceed with the treatment. Thank you.
