Hello, this is Dr. Lee from Hematology. I'm calling about a patient, Michael Brown, MRN 456789123, DOB 1975-08-20. We sent a blood sample for Coagulation Panel testing, but the results are showing abnormal clotting times. The patient is scheduled for surgery tomorrow, and we need to ensure there are no issues with the sample or the testing process. Can you verify the results and let us know if we need to collect a new sample? The patient's surgery is critical, and we need accurate results. Thank you.
