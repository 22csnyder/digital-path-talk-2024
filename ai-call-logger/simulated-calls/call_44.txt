Hi, this is Dr. Brown from Oncology. I'm calling about a patient, Lisa Green, MRN 334466778, DOB 1965-07-18. We sent a biopsy sample for Histopathology testing, but the results are inconclusive. The patient has a suspicious mass, and we need to confirm if it's malignant. Can you check if there's any issue with the sample or the testing process? We need to make a treatment decision as soon as possible. The patient's condition is critical, and we need accurate results. Thank you.
