Hello, this is Dr. Parker from Pediatrics. I'm calling about a patient, Lily Evans, MRN 112233445, DOB 2015-04-22. We sent a blood sample for Complete Blood Count (CBC) testing, but the results are showing low hemoglobin levels. The patient is experiencing fatigue and pallor. Can you verify the results and let us know if we need to collect a new sample? The patient's condition is concerning, and we need accurate results to proceed with the treatment. Thank you.
