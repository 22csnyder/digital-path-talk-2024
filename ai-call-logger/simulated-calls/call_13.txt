Hello, this is Dr. Robinson from Neurology. I'm calling about a patient, Anna Smith, MRN 334455667, DOB 1978-06-15. We sent a CSF sample for Multiple Sclerosis Panel testing, but the results are taking longer than expected. The patient has symptoms of MS, and we need to confirm the diagnosis to start the treatment. Can you check the status of the sample and expedite the testing process? The patient's condition is not improving, and we need the results urgently. Thank you.
