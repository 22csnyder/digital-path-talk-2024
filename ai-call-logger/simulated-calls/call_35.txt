Hello, this is Dr. Clark from Oncology. I'm calling about a patient, Susan Davis, MRN 556677889, DOB 1952-09-25. We sent a bone marrow sample for Myeloma Panel testing, but the results are showing conflicting markers. The patient has symptoms of multiple myeloma, and we need to confirm the diagnosis to start the treatment. Can you verify the results and let us know if we need to collect a new sample? The patient's condition is deteriorating, and we need accurate results to proceed with the treatment. Thank you.
