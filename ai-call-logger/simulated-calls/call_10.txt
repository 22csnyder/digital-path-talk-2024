Hi, this is Dr. Lewis from Nephrology. I'm calling about a patient, Karen Scott, MRN 654789321, DOB 1988-06-12. We sent a urine sample for Kidney Function testing, but the results are showing abnormal creatinine levels. The patient has symptoms of kidney failure, and we need to confirm the diagnosis to start the treatment. Can you check if there's any issue with the sample or the testing process? We need to make a treatment decision as soon as possible. The patient's condition is critical, and we need accurate results. Thank you.
