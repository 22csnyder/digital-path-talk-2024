Hello, this is Dr. Thompson from Gastroenterology. I'm calling about a patient, Robert King, MRN 990011223, DOB 1965-11-05. We sent a stool sample for C. difficile testing, but the results are inconclusive. The patient has severe diarrhea and abdominal pain, and we need to confirm the diagnosis to start the treatment. Can you check if there's any issue with the sample or the testing process? We need to make a treatment decision as soon as possible. The patient's condition is critical, and we need accurate results. Thank you.
