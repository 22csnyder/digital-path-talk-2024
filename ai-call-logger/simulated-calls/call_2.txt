Hi, this is Dr. Johnson from Neurology. I'm calling about a patient, Emily Clark, MRN 987654321, DOB 1990-05-15. We sent a CSF sample for Encephalopathy Auto Immune testing, but we haven't received the results yet. The patient is showing severe neurological symptoms, and we need the test results to proceed with the treatment. Can you check the status of the sample and expedite the testing process? The patient's condition is deteriorating, and we need to make a treatment decision as soon as possible. Thank you.
