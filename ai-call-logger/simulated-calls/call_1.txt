Hey, this is Dr. Smith from Cardiology. I'm calling about a patient, John Doe, MRN 123456789, DOB 1980-01-01. We sent a blood sample for Troponin testing, but the results are inconclusive. The patient is experiencing chest pain and elevated heart enzymes. We need to confirm if the sample was processed correctly or if we need to resend it. Can you check if there's any issue with the sample or if we need to collect a new one? The patient is in critical condition, and we need the results urgently. Thank you.
