Hi, this is Dr. Anderson from Infectious Disease. I'm calling about a patient, Jessica Brown, MRN 001122334, DOB 1992-04-18. We sent a blood sample for HIV testing, but the results are taking longer than expected. The patient has symptoms of acute HIV infection, and we need to confirm the diagnosis to start the treatment. Can you check the status of the sample and expedite the testing process? The patient's condition is not improving, and we need the results urgently. Thank you.
