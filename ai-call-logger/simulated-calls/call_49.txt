Hello, this is Dr. Purple from Gastroenterology. I'm calling about a patient, Emily Yellow, MRN 889911223, DOB 1990-02-02. We sent a stool sample for H. pylori testing, but the results are inconclusive. The patient has symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, and we need to confirm the diagnosis to start the treatment. Can you check if there's any issue with the sample or the testing process? We need to make a treatment decision as soon as possible. The patient's condition is critical, and we need accurate results. Thank you.
