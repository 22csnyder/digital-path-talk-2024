Hello, this is Dr. Black from Neurology. I'm calling about a patient, Michael White, MRN 445577889, DOB 1970-11-30. We sent a CSF sample for Oligoclonal Bands testing, but the results are taking longer than expected. The patient has symptoms of multiple sclerosis, and we need to confirm the diagnosis to start the treatment. Can you check the status of the sample and expedite the testing process? The patient's condition is not improving, and we need the results urgently. Thank you.
