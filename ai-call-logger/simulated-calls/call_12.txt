Hi, this is Dr. Taylor from Dermatology. I'm calling about a patient, Mark Johnson, MRN 223344556, DOB 1983-11-30. We sent a skin biopsy for Histopathology testing, but the results are inconclusive. The patient has a suspicious lesion, and we need to confirm if it's malignant. Can you check if there's any issue with the sample or the testing process? We need to make a treatment decision as soon as possible. The patient's condition is critical, and we need accurate results. Thank you.
