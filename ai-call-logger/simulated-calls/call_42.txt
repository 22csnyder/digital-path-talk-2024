Hi, this is Dr. Evans from Endocrinology. I'm calling about a patient, John Miller, MRN 112244556, DOB 1975-09-12. We sent a blood sample for HbA1c testing, but the results are showing unusually high levels. The patient has a history of diabetes, and we need to confirm the results to adjust the treatment plan. Can you verify the results and let us know if we need to collect a new sample? The patient's condition is critical, and we need accurate results. Thank you.
