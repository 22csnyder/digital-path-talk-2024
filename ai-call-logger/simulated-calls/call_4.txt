Hi, this is Dr. Davis from Endocrinology. I'm calling about a patient, Sarah White, MRN 321654987, DOB 1985-03-10. We sent a serum sample for Thyroid Function testing, but the results are inconsistent with the patient's clinical presentation. The patient has symptoms of hyperthyroidism, but the test results are normal. Can you check if there's any issue with the sample or the testing process? We need to confirm the diagnosis and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. The patient's condition is worsening, and we need accurate results. Thank you.
