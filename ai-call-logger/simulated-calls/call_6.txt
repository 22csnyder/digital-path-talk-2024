Hi, this is Dr. Wilson from Rheumatology. I'm calling about a patient, Laura Adams, MRN 654321789, DOB 1982-07-30. We sent a blood sample for Rheumatoid Factor testing, but the results are showing borderline levels. The patient has joint pain and swelling, and we need to confirm the diagnosis to start the treatment. Can you verify the results and let us know if we need to collect a new sample? The patient's symptoms are worsening, and we need accurate results to proceed with the treatment. Thank you.
