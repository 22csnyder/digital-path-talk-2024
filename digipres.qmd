## AI Hootenanny

::::: columns

### Pervasive Hype 
- focus is on heralding future innovation
- my Natural Language Processing(NLP) professor around 2018 lamented that his work seems to follow him home in the news
- will reshape our daily lives - similar to industrial revolution - eventually reaches "Singularity" - potential to "transform healthcare"

## Objectives

### outline
1.  Outline the mechanisms by which AI adapts and accelerates real world workflows *today* (from my tenor as a pathology resident)
2.  Explain conceptually: how to anticipate when AI will be useful to apply to a particualr circumstance.
3.  Demonstrate "hands-off" informatics implementation of AI solutions, also made possible by AI.
4.  Give a Theoretical Basis: why proficiency in ai-tools (in-principle) should be (a) empowering and (b) eventually universal, vis-a-vis literacy
5.  Introduce Diagramatically a classification system for AI-Application facilitating computer-tasks.
6.  Automate Call Log Entry via an AI Application. <!-- - entry of call metadata into the pathology resident call-log form from simulated call audio. -->
::: { .smaller .indent=2em}
-   if time, show how an AI agent can be used to append, modify, save, query, analyze past log-entries.
-   if time, show easy integration with downstream informatic-endpoints e.g. email notification for impending sample expiration, ai entry summarization and report generation.

##### AI aided approach
```{bash}
gh copilot suggest "please compress my file with `tar` command
  Use the most common, generic approach.
  You know what I want...Just do the thing, please."

| Benefit | Communication Example |
|----|----|
| Economies of Scope | \-  enlisting adults<br>- Multi-disciplinary <br>[ - **learning from data**]{.fragment fragment-index="1"} |
| Economies of Scale | \- cooperation <br>- minimum staffing, redundancy <br>[ - **automating tasks**]{.fragment fragment-index="1"} |

## Communication Key to Efficiency

- AI may result in removal of virtually all workflow inefficiencies 

-   By lowering the barrier working with computers, and by expanding the pool of practitioners who can do so, AI stands to remove essentially all present workflow inefficiencies

-   everything is worth the squeeze when you have a juicer
<!-- -   *inefficiency*: gap between "knowing what to do" and "being done"

-   inefficiency can be reduced by communication with peers

-   Example: HMA (Hematologic Malignancy Algorithm)

    -   extensive communication in advance with oncologists
    -   streamlines adding molecular testing once indicated <!-- [hma algorithm](src/language/hma.png) -->

<!-- -   Many inefficiencies are amenable to an informatics solution -->

## AI Tools For Computer Use (summary)

::: notes
these are my notes
:::

0.  task to code (by hand)

-   tedious, "too literal": always requires 100% specification

1.  task as prompt

-   easy, difficult to specify what you mean precisely enough

2.  task to code

-   Can jumpstart coding, modifying easier than writing

3.  code as prompt

-   sweet spot: clearly specifies what you want the output to "look like" while leaving the details to the model

## Core Recommendation

We should prepare for the future like it's already here. And, by the time we are ready, it will be.

It is exactly because medicine will have the most obstacles to AI adoption that we need to plan the farthest ahead.
