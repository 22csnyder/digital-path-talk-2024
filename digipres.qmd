## Big Claims are Being Made about AI

## Prophecies are Rarely Actionable
- What should I do differently?
  - "now" even less clear than "later"
![](src/ai-clueless.avif)
- Is it "too early" to pay attention?

## Little Evidence to Inform Preparation

##### What is the best approach?
- to date, business as usual
- maybe "wait and see"

## Objectives

1. Introduce "Computers that Know What You Mean" as an **existing** and transformative AI technology

    2. Highlight being "Conversant" in Computing as a natural extension of language, literacy, or teamwork.

2. Provide examples of how "Computers that Know What You Mean" can empower non-technical users to develop informatics solutions with minimal effort.

3. Demonstrate the impact of "Computers that Know What You Mean" on the relationship between computers and humans, essentially allowing for **computers that do what you want**.

4. Provide recommendations for how medical informatics professionals, and systems of professionals can best leverage this transformative technology in their work.


## Computers usually *don't* always* know what you mean

::: {.columns}

```python
dff=pd.read_sql(
  f""" SELECT *
        FROM results
        WHERE {ASSAY} == "{task_assay}"
        AND {CONTROL_MATERIAL} == "{control_material}"
        AND {STATUS} not in {bad_result_status}
        AND {PERFORMED_TIMESTAMP} > '{start_date}'
  """,conn)
```
- precise syntax required

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}


```bash
# Compress a file
tar -czvf file.tar.gz file

#show port forwards
netsh interface portproxy show v4tov4

#mount a network drive
mount -t drvfs /mnt/Box
```
- memorized(?) incantations

## Communication Key to Efficiency 

* *inefficiency*: gap between "knowing what to do" and "being done"
* inefficiency can be reduced by communication with peers

* Example: HMA (Hematologic Malignancy Algorithm)
  * extensive communication in advance with oncologists
  * streamlines adding molecular testing once indicated
  <!-- [hma algorithm](src/language/hma.png) -->
* Many inefficiencies are amenable to an informatics solution
  * however, often "the juice isn't worth the squeeze"

* By lowering the barrier working with computers, and by expanding the pool of practitioners who can do so, AI stands to  remove essentially all present workflow inefficiencies
  * everything is worth the squeeze when you have a juicer

## AI Tools For Computer Use (summary)

:::notes
these are my notes 
:::
0. task to code (by hand)
  - tedious, "too literal": always requires 100% specification

1. task as prompt
  - easy, difficult to specify what you mean precisely enough

2. task to code
  - Can jumpstart coding, modifying easier than writing

3. code as prompt
  - sweet spot: clearly specifies what you want the output to "look like" while leaving the details to the model

## Core Recommendation


We should prepare for the future like it's already here. 
And, by the time we are ready, it will be. 

It is exactly because medicine will have the most obstacles to AI adoption that we need to plan the farthest ahead.
