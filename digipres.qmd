## Big Claims are Being Made about AI


<!-- ![AI Conceptual Image](ai-conceptual.jpg) -->

- most transformative technology since industrialization
- "Self-improving AI" - "Singularity"

## Prophecies are Rarely Actionable
- What should I do differently?
  - "now" even less clear than "later"
![](src/ai-clueless.avif)
- Is it "too early" to pay attention?

## Little Evidence to Inform Preparation
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
##### What is the best approach?
- to date, business as usual
- maybe "wait and see"
  - conservative ≠ safe

## Objectives

1. Introduce "Computers that Know What You Mean" as an **existing** and transformative AI technology

    2. Highlight being "Conversant" in Computing as a natural extension of language, literacy, or teamwork.

2. Provide examples of how "Computers that Know What You Mean" can empower non-technical users to develop informatics solutions with minimal effort.

3. Demonstrate the impact of "Computers that Know What You Mean" on the relationship between computers and humans, essentially allowing for **computers that do what you want**.

4. Provide recommendations for how medical informatics professionals, and systems of professionals can best leverage this transformative technology in their work.


## Computers usually *don't* always* know what you mean

```python
dff=pd.read_sql(
  f""" SELECT *
        FROM results
        WHERE {ASSAY} == "{task_assay}"
        AND {CONTROL_MATERIAL} == "{control_material}"
        AND {STATUS} not in {bad_result_status}
        AND {PERFORMED_TIMESTAMP} > '{start_date}'
  """,conn)
```
- precise syntax required
