Hi, this is Dr. Yellow from Rheumatology. I'm calling about a patient, Robert Blue, MRN 778800112, DOB 1978-08-08. We sent a blood sample for ANA testing, but the results are showing borderline levels. The patient has symptoms of lupus, and we need to confirm the diagnosis to start the treatment. Can you verify the results and let us know if we need to collect a new sample? The patient's symptoms are worsening, and we need accurate results to proceed with the treatment. Thank you.
