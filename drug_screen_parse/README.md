# Drug Screen Result Parse
A jumble of readouts from drug screen result reports that I only discovered because I bothered Vahid about what he was up to and he showed me this. I thought it was interesting to think about the ways one might approach parsing this.


## Goal:
Untanlge this mess to determine which drug-patient pairs were positive (or negative).
